# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **demand forecasting and inventory optimization** using machine learning. By analyzing historical sales data, we predict future demand and optimize inventory levels to reduce stockouts and overstock situations. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions for efficient inventory management.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Managing inventory efficiently is crucial for businesses to avoid losses from excess stock or missed sales due to stockouts. This project leverages **time series forecasting** and **machine learning algorithms** to predict demand accurately and suggest optimal inventory levels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- **Machine Learning Models**: ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  

## 📂 Dataset Details
- The dataset contains historical sales data, including product IDs, timestamps, demand quantity, and other relevant features.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering for better forecasting accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Time Series Forecasting: Predicts future demand based on historical sales data.
- Machine Learning Models: Compares different models to choose the best-performing one.
- Inventory Optimization: Suggests stock levels to minimize wastage and prevent stockouts.
- Data Visualization: Interactive graphs to understand demand trends and seasonality.

## 📈 Results & Insights
